				<span class='story-summary'>After two weeks of learning how carbs work, breathing more carb cleaner than I care to think about I git it all put back together. I mounted the carbs, hit the starter and...it worked! The bike turned over for a bit then fired up. It sounded really good!</span>

				<span class='story-summary'>Starting my first motorcycle build. I found a 1980 Honda CB750 on Craigslist that wasn't running but just needed a carb rebuild. I went and looked at it and it seemed to be in good shape overall. It had a new battery, new back tire, and even came with a windjammer fairing that was terribly ugly! These are just a few before pictures.</span>
