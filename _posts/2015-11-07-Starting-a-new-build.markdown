title:  Starting a new build
summary: Starting my first motorcycle build. I found a 1980 Honda CB750 on Craigslist that wasn't running but just needed a carb rebuild. I went and looked at it and it seemed to be in good shape overall. It had a new battery, new back tire, and even came with a windjammer fairing that was terribly ugly!

    comment: It even came with a "beautiful" fairing that was quickly removed.
