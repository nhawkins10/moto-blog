	<p>Hey, I'm Nathan and I started this blog as a place where I could record the progress of my first motorcycle build. I started riding motorcycles as a teenager when my family got a 100cc Honda dirt bike. I spent many happy hours on that thing cruising around our forty acres. I rode around pastures, down creeks, tried to jump terraces, and one time crashed the bike in our front yard right in front of my mom. I went off to college and was only able to ride occasionally, but always found riding to be a good way to relax and unwind. </p>
	<p>Street bikes had intrigued me for a long time and I'd thought about getting one before, but had never actually decided to get one. One day I happed upon a picture of a stripped down old Honda that instantly intrigued  me and led me to the world of cafe racers, brats and other custom bikes. After spending a lot of time looking at these bikes online, I decided that I needed to have one. I began browsing Craigslist for a good bike, and eventually found a 1980 Honda CB750 that won me over. I borrowed my brother's truck, picked it up, and so began my bike building journey. I've thouroughly enjoyed the process so far and always look forward to whatever opportunities I have to work on it. </p>
	<p>I hope you enjoy looking through the pictures of the work that I've done. Maybe you'll find something that helps you in a current build or inspires you to start building your own. <!--I'd love to hear any feedback from you or to see pictures of your build. You can shoot me an email at mail@restorationmoto.com.--></p>
